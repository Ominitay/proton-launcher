# Proton Application Launcher

### Prerequisites
This script requires `curl`, `sed`, `grep`, and `awk` to run correctly. Please check that you have these packages installed with the relevant package manager before continuing.

### Installation
To get the scripts, execute the command in the same directory of the executable you would like to use them with.

> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ominitay/proton-launcher/master/installerstub | bash

This will automatically download the two scripts (`update` and `launch`), along with a default config file. You will need to modify the config to your needs, with any spaces in file or directory names being escaped with a single `\`.

### Usage - WIP
Run either of the scripts with the `-h` option to output their help pages.
